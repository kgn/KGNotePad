KGNotePad is a text view complete with lines and torn paper.

![](https://raw.github.com/kgn/KGNotePad/master/screenshot.png)

KGNotePad works with most fonts out of the box, some fonts require the  `lineOffset` value to be set. 
This is hopefully something that can be fixed in the future but I'm not seeing the pattern through 
the numbers to know how to compute what this offset should be… if you know please share :)

Check out the Example project to see the view in action!
